   abstract                      = {IS research has extensively examined the role of trust in client-vendor relationships, as well as the role of governance in information technology (IT) outsourcing, but little research has been carried out on the latest manifestation of outsourcing—namely, microsourcing, i.e., the sourcing of smaller scale projects. To extend the literature on the traditional IT outsourcing literature—a stream that largely focuses on medium-to-large scale offline projects—we investigate how to develop trust and commitment in a triadic microsourcing relationship which includes the microsourcer, the microsourcee, and the microsourcing platform (MP). We draw on transaction cost economics (TCE) to theorize a model specifically adapted to the microsourcing phenomenon to scrutinize the influences of formal contractual mechanisms, relational mechanisms, and third-party mechanisms. Combining data from a matched sample of microsourcers and microsourcees on the leading Chinese MP, Zbj.com, the paper deploys degree-symmetric modeling (DSM) for construct conceptualization, measurement, and data analysis. DSM is consistent with the holistic view used to develop the research model for triadic relationships. Findings confirm that the MP is critical in delivering governance mechanisms to ensure the development of triadic trust and commitment. The results suggest that researchers and practitioners should pay closer attention to triadic trust and commitment building through proper governance mechanisms in the online microsourcing marketplace. We argue that this work could be extended to other online digital platforms that involve multiple transacting parties.},

   abstract                      = {Offshore outsourcing has increased to the point where it is now part of the mainstream consciousness. The same tools that enable remote work sharing in corporations also allow individuals to outsource their own work (microsourcing)—either with company approval or covertly. As an innovative work practice, microsourcing can bring greater flexibility to the workforce. It also has the potential to undermine control of the work process as well as introducing new risks and ethical issues to the workplace. The appearance of brokers to facilitate microsourcing suggests that entrepreneurs perceive there is a demand for these arrangements. Due to the potential threats to intellectual property, even employers and managers who do not use or approve of the practice should take some steps to educate themselves about microsourcing. This research is the first known attempt to use a theoretical framework to understand microsourcing as an individual level work strategy as well as its context and drivers. This study uses Structuration Theory as a guideline in the investigation of different microsourcing implementations.},

   abstract                      = {A significant procedure to ensure the consumer supply is Power System Restoration (PSR). Due to the increase of the number of distributed generators in the grid, it is possible to shift from the conventional PSR to a new strategy involving the use of distributed energy resources (DER). In this paper, a decentralized multi-agent system (MAS) is proposed to cope with the restoration procedure in a microgrid (MG). Each agent is assigned to a specific consumer or microsource (MS), communicating with other agents at every stage of the restoration procedure so that a common decision is reached. The 0/1 knapsack problem is the problem that every agent solves to determine the best load connection sequence during the restoration of the MG. Two different case studies are used to test the MAS on a dynamically modeled benchmark MG: a total blackout and a partial blackout. Regarding the partial blackout case, demand response emergency programs are considered to manage the loads in the MG. The MAS is developed in Matlab/Simulink environment and by performing the corresponding dynamic simulations it is possible to validate this system towards sustainability.},

It becomes a significant factor for the increasing recognition of online sourcing as an alternative outsourcing option. Despite the adoption of individuals and small and medium enterprises, there is a dearth of study that looks into the service providers (workers) in OSM. This paper addresses this gap by exploring the experiences of online workers from the Philippines, particularly software developers engaged in independent online work. Findings found at least six themes prevalent to online software developers (OSDs) including uncertainty and transitions, trust and work agreements, reputation and client relationships, accomplishing tasks, platforms and software support, and work practices. The study suggests that by looking at the experiences of software developers, current and future clients (employers) can gain insights in considering this outsourcing option. Moreover, OSMs can consider the needs of OSDs presented in this study as inputs in customizing their services.},

   abstract                      = {Given the increasing amount of information being leveraged in business models, a growing number of companies have adopted differential privacy (DP) as a means of ensuring privacy. DP enables the adjustment of privacy characteristics of individual information. Nevertheless, measurements taken rarely lead to total prevention of information loss due to external events, i.e., data breaches. Owing to the control nature of DP, we argue that even in the occurrence of a data breach, investments made in this technology can be strategically exploited to positively influence perceived information privacy control. Drawing on prior literature, we propose a relationship between customers’ information privacy control and satisfaction. By conducting a between-subjects experiment (n=185), we can confirm these assumptions. Our paper paves the way for the disclosure of privacy measures, in particular DP, to enable a more positive reaction of customers towards data breaches, thus creating competitive advantages.},

Thus, gaining a deep understanding of the adoption of online sourcingbecomes particularly important. Drawing upon theories of firms including transaction cost theory, we propose an integrativetheoretical framework for the understanding of online sourcing decisions from the service clients’ perspective. The researchmodel is examined with the data collected from an online sourcing platform. Our findings suggest integrative theoreticalframework rather than single perspective in understanding online sourcing decisions. Moreover, the study discloses howdifferent theories are interrelated within an integrative theoretical framework under online sourcing context, as well as therelative importance of each theoretical perspective.},

However, we know little about what relations exist between and among actors on digital platforms. Findings of mutually beneficial interactions, cooperation, and value creation contrast findings of power, dependency, control, governance, rules, and competition in the ecosystem. To shed light on this issue, we conduct a structured literature review of information systems and management literature. In 144 studies, we find 19 different relations between and among platform owner, complementors, and end-users. We contribute to research in three ways. First, by discovering that instability of roles on digital platforms explains dual roles and the dynamics of roles more holistically than concepts that account for specific dual roles. Second, by finding weighting in the relations. Third, by observing nestedness of relations.},

Large-scale studies with average samples exceeding 144,000 observations have considered over 70 variables explaining contracting decisions. Our review aims to facilitate the convergence towards commonly agreed categories of variables and overarching models of contracting decisions in this context. To mitigate the risk of propagating deflated p-values associated with large sample studies, we propose a robust version of vote-counting techniques. The principal findings of our research suggest that only a few variables related to the client-worker relationship, the bid and individual worker characteristics have a practically significant effect on worker selection, and that auction success is primarily affected by project value and client experience. These findings lay the groundwork for future research that will lead to better explanations of contracting decisions.},

   abstract                      = {Crowdsourcing (CS) of micro tasks is a relatively new, open source work form enabled by information and communication technologies. While anecdotal evidence of its benefits abounds, our understanding of the phenomenon’s societal consequences remains limited. Drawing on value sensitive design (VSD), we explore microtask CS as perceived by crowd workers, revealing their values as a means of informing the design of CS platforms. Analyzing detailed narratives of 210 crowd workers participating in Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk), we uncover a set of nine values they share: access, autonomy, fairness, transparency, communication, security, accountability, making an impact, and dignity. We find that these values are implicated in four crowdsourcing structures: compensation, governance, technology, and microtask. Two contrasting perceptions—empowerment and marginalization—coexist, forming a duality of microtask CS. The study contributes to the CS and VSD literatures, heightens awareness of worker marginalization in microtask CS, and offers guidelines for improving CS practice. Specifically, we offer recommendations regarding the ethical use of crowd workers (including for academic research), and call for improving MTurk platform design for greater worker empowerment.},

Although prior research has investigated bidders’ participating motivations and clients’ selection criteria, knowledge about how bidders could leverage appropriate bidding strategies to boost their performance is limited. Synthesizing extant literature on auction and crowdsourcing, we advance skill, spatial, and proposal differentiations as client-oriented strategies, which when combined with their rival-oriented counterparts, will dictate bidders’ performance on crowdsourcing platforms. To validate our hypotheses, we collected secondary data from a leading crowdsourcing platform in China. Bidder-level analysis revealed that skill differentiation positively affected bidding performance. Conversely, spatial differentiation exerted a negative impact while the effects of proposal differentiation turned out to be mixed. Moreover, bid sequence and category concentration were found to moderate the effect of client-oriented strategies partially. Theoretical and practical implications are further discussed.},

In general, Egyptian entrepreneurs have positive perceptions of CC and note its various actualized affordances: accessing information technology (IT) resources rapidly, broadening reach and transferring responsibility. The use of CC has yielded diverse effects: shortened time to market, reduced costs, a diversified audience and more useful feedback. We also identify what inhibits the use of CC, including transparency and corruption problems, limited support for online transactions, unsupportive government policies, low appreciation from the domestic market, cumbersome bureaucracy, account hacking and unreliable infrastructure. Finally, we also reveal some enabling factors, including institutional support, overseas market potential and CC uptake (i.e., growing use).},

However, there is no clear document in the literature that actually explains what is really going on in healthcare outsourcing. The purpose of this paper is to provide a current picture of healthcare outsourcing while focusing on the role of IT as an enabler.

Drawing on the literature of social media and team creativity in organizations, we develop a theoretical framework to explain how social media usage influences team creativity through cognitive trust and affective trust. The result of this study confirms the significant effect of both cognitive trust and affective trust on team creativity and the influence of social media usage on both types of trust. In addition, our findings showed that cognitive trust positively affects affective trust. Based on the results, we also provided theoretical and practical implications.},

We theorize that two job characteristics in cross-national labor demand settings strengthen effectiveness of these signals: job duration, and cultural distance. Econometric analysis on a dataset from a leading online freelance job marketplace containing information on jobs posted by buyers and completed by suppliers located across several countries supports our hypotheses. We find that both skill and achievement signals are more effective at inferring supplier quality in jobs involving longer duration, and in jobs involving greater cultural distance between buyers and suppliers.},

The emergence of social commerce (SC) might help ameliorate this situation. Social commerce is a new evolution of e-commerce that combines the commercial and social activities by deploying social technologies into e-commerce sites. Social commerce reintroduces the social aspect of shopping to e-commerce, increasing the degree of social presences in online environment. Drawing upon the social presence theory, this study theorizes the nature of social aspect in online SC marketplace by proposing a set of three social presence variables. These variables are then hypothesized to have positive impacts on trusting beliefs which in turn result in online purchase behaviors. The research model is examined via data collected from a typical ecommerce site in China. Our findings suggest that social presence factors grounded in social technologies contribute significantly to the building of the trustworthy online exchanging relationships. In doing so, this paper confirms the positive role of social aspect in shaping online purchase behaviors, providing a theoretical evidence for the fusion of social and commercial activities. Finally, this paper introduces a new perspective of e-commerce and calls more attention to this new phenomenon.},

We describe how these platforms work and the profiles of some typical digital crowdworkers. We also provide guidelines for IT leaders who want to benefit from this “hidden” source of skilled digital workers.},

   abstract                      = {Drawing upon perceived justice and trust literature, this study developed a research model to examine two types of platform assurances, specifically policy assurance and technology assurance, on users’ continuance intention towards “Xianghubao”, which is recognized as one of the largest online healthcare mutual aid platform supported by blockchain technology. A free simulation experiment was conducted and structural equation modelling technique was used to test the research model. The empirical results suggested that two assurance mechanisms exhibited significant influences on perceived procedural justice and trust, which further promoted continuance intention to different degrees. This study contributes to the extant literature by identifying blockchain technology as a salient technology assurance in the context of online healthcare platform, and uncovering its influence mechanism on continuance intention from a lens of justice and trust.},
